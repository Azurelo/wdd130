      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        The purpose of this site is to build revenue for Haulapai
        Gas N Grub by attracting the attention of locals. It is meant to inform
        anyone with questions about what products we carry by displaying
        lists of our departments and various products that fall inside those departments.
        It will be easy to navigate and the layout will be simple. Products will be displayed
        by logos or images of individual products. This will showcase what we carry at
        our store so people can stop by when they see something they want on our page.

        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        The small images in top right and footer middle will be phone icons 
        that have the stations number so customers can contact us quickly.
        The sections for the drink and snacks on the home page will have links
        and there might be similarlly styled cards duplicated to show a tobaco
        and propane/carwash page for future development.
      </p>
      <p>
        More bulky chunks of text may be added to the bottom of the page in the future 
        but the goal of the site is to keep things nice and simple so there isn't a need 
        for words. The snacks and drinks potential drop down may have more text or pictures.
        Future pages will also have more text explaining the miscellaneous features of Gas N Grub.
      </p>
      <img src="images/wireframehome.png" alt="home page wireframe">

      <h3>Drinks</h3>
      <p>         
        The drinks page will have cards holding images of snacks and may
        have future style changes to show how a drop down or change in the page 
        displays extra info when clicked. There may also be multiple rows if there 
        are more than 5 categories.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some work may be done in the future to add a fountain drink section 
        to the drinks page and this could have the same card structure but be 
        placed above the brands section.
