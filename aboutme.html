        What's up!? My name is Justus.
         I am 20 years old and live in Arizona.
         I am trying to obtain a Software Development BS and hope that goes swimmingly.

        I like programming a lot so far and beside that 
        I just got my first motorcycle and am loving it.
        When I'm not doing school I work at a gas station that 
        has blessed my life a lot by exposing me to all kinds of people. 
        In my little free time I've been trying to learn 3D modeling and
        when thats too frustrating I play video games.
